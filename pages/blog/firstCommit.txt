You are my people

I never had a childhood. I grew up too fast. Between hardcore
religion, overbearing parents and a brother with a 
proclivity for violence I grew up fast. I never felt like I 
was part of my family. I still don't.

I was raised to not use the internet or trust modern media.
It took me too many years to start using the internet in any
meaningful way. Now I feel like I have found my people. This 
hog-pog group of misfits that tinker on computers and nerd out
on all things. 

People that know quotes to too many movies and have a strong
opinion on just about everything. I didn't have those people in
my home town. I didn't have those people in my university. I 
found you all while I was online. 

I hope this can give back something that you have given me. A 
family that I get to choose and a great group of people. 

Thank you.
